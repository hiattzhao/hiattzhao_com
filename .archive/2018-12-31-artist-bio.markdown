Made in China and assembled in the USA, Hiatt Zhao was born in Beijing and moved to the U.S. before becoming a teenager. He currently resides in Pennsylvania.

Hiatt has been taking photographs for many years and is best known for his abstract architectural photographs, in addition to other more "traditional" photographs. His photos have been publicly exhibited numerous times in galleries since he was 19 years old. They have been collected by a well known university in upstate New York. Collectors of Hiatt's work often include leaders of corporations. Subsequently, the photographs have been displayed in offices around the world, including Beijing, Shanghai, and New York City. While individuals collect his work, private institutions have also used his photographs commercially. Moreover, Hiatt has published two books on photography.
