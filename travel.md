  <p>My first solo traveling was a 45 days Greyhound bus trip around the US when I was 19 years old. Consequently, it boosted my interest in photography.</p>
  <p>I didn't travel for ten years, until I was 29 years old. I had some health struggles in my twenties, but I realized that life is about experiencing the world and it's my goal to travel the world before I die. I decided to travel on average 30 days out of every year. So in 2013, I couchsurfed from Alaska to Mexico along the West Coast of United States for 40 days.</p>
  <p>A year later, I took a solo road trip up the Hudson River Valley and arrived in Burlington, Vermont. I was planning to go east all the way to Cape Cod, but I had to head home after a week's stay at the hospital.</p>
  <p>I finished my master degree in finance from 2014 to 2015 then I went out west again. This time, with two friends from graduate school, we went to Salt Lake City, Yellowstone National Park, Antelope Canyon, Grand Canyon, and Las Vegas.</p>
  <p>I kept my promise of travel every year and in 2016 I spent a month in western Europe where I traveled to London, France, Spain, and Portugal.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, I didn't do any traveling next year, but I made it up the following year when I bicycled across the United States from Philadelphia to San Francisco in 100 days. This was the best adventure I've had so far in my life.</p>
