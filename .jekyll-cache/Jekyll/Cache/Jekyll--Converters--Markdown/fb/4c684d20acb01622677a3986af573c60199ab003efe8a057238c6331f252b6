I"0<p>Today, I did a simple exercise. I wrote down the things I would do if I wasn’t limited by time or money, then I picked the top 5 things I would focus on right now. Lastly, I made my goals more specific to my current situation. So here are my top 5 short term goals:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write in journal</li>
  <li>Read books</li>
  <li>Play guitar</li>
  <li>Make YouTube videos</li>
  <li>Learn/Study for the CFA Foundations exam</li>
</ol>

<p>These are the things I should be focusing on by cutting out all the distractions. The 5th goal is where I’ll be applying my #30by7project. I will study for the CFA Foundations exam for at least 30 minutes per day. Though it will take me longer than a week to finish the preparations, I hope to complete my studies in a month.</p>

<p>However, there’s another goal that I want to achieve, it’s a goal in the future, maybe 10 years down the line. It’s to travel the world by bicycle. Since that requires a foundamental lifestyle change, it’ll have to be in a different category of its own and have its own goals.</p>
