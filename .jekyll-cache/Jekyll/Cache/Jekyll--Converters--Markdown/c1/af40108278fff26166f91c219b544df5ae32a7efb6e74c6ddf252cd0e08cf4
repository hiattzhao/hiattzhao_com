I"b<p>Two years ago, I tried to do a #30DaysOfCode to get better at web development. It’s a self imposed challenge where I would practice coding for 30 days straight. I didn’t complete that challenge and I think I only finished half way. Recently, I thought about what I did wrong and what I should change if I were to do something like that again.</p>
