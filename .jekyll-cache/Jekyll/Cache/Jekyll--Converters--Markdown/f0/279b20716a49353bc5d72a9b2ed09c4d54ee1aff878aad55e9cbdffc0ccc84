I"f<p>When I was in high school, I thought success was getting the best grades so I can attend a good college. When I was in college, I thought success was getting the best grades so I can go to medical school or graduate school. I didnâ€™t go to medical school after all and I only ended up going to graduate school 8 years after I graduated from college.</p>
