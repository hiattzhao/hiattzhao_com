I"š<p>Iâ€™ve been staring at the computer screen for about 15 minutes trying to think of what to write for my first post on this website. Nothing and everything comes to mind. I think itâ€™s what people call all-or-nothing thinking. Iâ€™m good at that.</p>

<p>Thinking comes naturally to me. Some people, such as my mom, tell me that I think too much, but I think people are always thinking. Iâ€™ve only been thinking for the past 35 years. There are plenty of people who have thought twice as much.</p>

<p>I guess what Iâ€™m trying to do is to transcribe something in a vacuum - my mind - to something visual - words - so that you can peak inside my head. I donâ€™t know why you would want to step into someone elseâ€™s head, but itâ€™s something we tend to do. Like watching a TV show or reading a book.</p>

<p>I do have to say that Iâ€™m an interesting person. Though, my mom once told me that Iâ€™m very boring. I might not be the most interesting, but interesting enough. And I want to expand my interest by writing.</p>

<p>I started keeping a private journal about 10 years ago. I tried to write a public blog a few times, but I always let time get the best of me. For some reason, I kept writing on the journal. I think itâ€™s because I feel thereâ€™s no pressure for anyone to criticize me. As a result, thereâ€™s no limit to my writing, no matter how bad it is, Iâ€™m the only judge.</p>

<p>To test this hypothesis, Iâ€™m going to do the same on this blog. Just write whatever and see what comes out of it. Itâ€™s my hope that something of value will result, either for you or me.</p>
