I"<p>I am an explorer of life, both in the physical space and in the mental realm. I seek riches. They are memories, experiences, talents, knowledge, and wisdom.</p>

<p>To achieve these things I need to learn, travel, and experience as much as I can in life. Thus, I grant myself to make mistakes and to celebrate my wins.</p>

<p>I also know that my emotions are subjective, so enjoying every single moment is the key to a beautiful life.</p>

<p>I must do what I love and do them often. I must share with the world with what I have. And I must help others when I can. Because I want to leave a better world than the one I arrived.</p>

<p>Remember that Iâ€™m capable of much more than I think.</p>

<p>And do good. Always.</p>
