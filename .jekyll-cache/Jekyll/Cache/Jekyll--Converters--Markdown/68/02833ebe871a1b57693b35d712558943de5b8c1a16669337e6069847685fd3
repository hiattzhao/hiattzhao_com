I"Š<p>Itâ€™s been a week since I started my first <a href="/2020/01/18/30-by-7-project.html" target="_blank">#30by7project</a>. There are some things I learned about my behavior and my habits that I think are helpful in revising my goals for the next several #30by7projects.</p>

<p>I learned that I get really tired after I come home and eat dinner. I think itâ€™s the result of both work and food coma. Itâ€™s not ideal for me to do things that require a lot of focus. Thus, I tend to do more creative tasks in the early evenings, such as writing.</p>

<p>Even though my first weekâ€™s goal was to make a YouTube video every day, it didnâ€™t work as planned. I recorded several, but only found one thatâ€™s decent enough to upload. What I did next was to switch to a goal of playing the guitar every day for a week. As of this Saturday morning, Iâ€™ve played the guitar three times this week for at least half an hour each. Three out of 7 is a failing grade in my book, but to see a more complete picture, Iâ€™ve read chapters in two books 5 days out of the 7 and have written something 4 days out of 7. I didnâ€™t have a #30by7project goal of reading and writing initially, but I included them because I do them outside of work and they will improve myself.</p>

<p>It looks like the best strategy for me to complete my #30by7project goals is to do multiple #30by7projects simultaneously. If I complete three goals in three weeks, thatâ€™s an average of one goal per week. If some goals become habits, such as reading and writing, then I will continue to do them as long as they provide enjoyment and value. I think thatâ€™s the ultimate goal of doing a #30by7project.</p>
