  <p>Over the years, I've produced four photography books.</p>
  <p>The first book, Teenage American Travel, is a collection of 300 photographs from my 45 days Greyhound bus travels around the US in the summer of 2003. It was published in 2007 and complemented my first solo photography exhibition at Ambre Gallery in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.</p>
  <p>The second book is The Artistic Portfolio of Hiatt Zhao. It included my past drawings, paintings, models, digital art, etc. I had planned to apply to graduate architecture schools with it, but ended up not doing so.</p>
  <p>Architecture Perspective is the title of my third and fourth books. Each contains the 30 photographs that were exhibited in my first solo exhibition. The hardcover has cropped photos and the softcover has all the original photos, but the paper quality is subpar to the hardcover version. There is also a Kindle edition of the softcover edition.</p>
