It’s all made up. There is no money. It’s all made up. There is no status. It’s all made up. But there is you. There is me. There is us. Anything else is an illusion. There is a link between you and me. And there are links between us and them. Until we realize that they are us and us is them, fame, money, status are all illusions. Something deep inside of us connects us. Some call it God, some call it soul, some call it spirit. Let that be apparent and let the illusions disappear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just do your best and let your intuition guide you. There are no mandatory books to read. No required course to take. The only guide you have is your feelings. Feelings deep inside. Accessed by the music you enjoy, the conversations you cherish, the books you like. Do the things that makes you feel good. Eventually, you’ll be recognized for being you. The unique you. Not the money you made, the fame you acquired, and the status you gained. Take your time. Everything will be fine and everything is according to plan.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Hiatt Zhao</name></author><summary type="html">There is no fame. It’s all made up. There is no money.

I received so many presents, mostly toys, that I felt like I was in heaven. It seems like as I get older each year I want fewer and fewer things for Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m very grateful for what I have. A place to live, a reliable car, a great family, great friends, easy access to several great grocery stores, enough clothes to wear, a computer and internet, a great job, a nice bicycle in case I need to exercise, and most importantly, good health. I simply don’t need anything else. In fact, I should be getting rid of some things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for Christmas this year, my list is bare. But that doesn’t mean it’s empty. If you would like to gift me something, I suggest donate to your favorite charity. One of my favorite charities is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.givedirectly.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GiveDirectly&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a well ranked non-profit organization that gives money directly to the poor. Since income inequality is something that I feel strongly against, I feel this organization does a great job to help the needy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope I don’t sound selfish to say that I don’t want anything for Christmas. However, I feel as a member of the society, I’m in a good place and there are others who need more help than me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Hiatt Zhao</name></author><summary type="html">I still remember my first Christmas in 1995 when I arrived in the US.

Nothing and everything comes to mind. I think it’s what people call all-or-nothing thinking. I’m good at that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking comes naturally to me. Some people, such as my mom, tell me that I think too much, but I think people are always thinking. I’ve only been thinking for the past 35 years. There are plenty of people who have thought twice as much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess what I’m trying to do is to transcribe something in a vacuum - my mind - to something visual - words - so that you can peak inside my head. I don’t know why you would want to step into someone else’s head, but it’s something we tend to do. Like watching a TV show or reading a book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do have to say that I’m an interesting person. Though, my mom once told me that I’m very boring. I might not be the most interesting, but interesting enough. And I want to expand my interest by writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started keeping a private journal about 10 years ago. I tried to write a public blog a few times, but I always let time get the best of me. For some reason, I kept writing on the journal. I think it’s because I feel there’s no pressure for anyone to criticize me. As a result, there’s no limit to my writing, no matter how bad it is, I’m the only judge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test this hypothesis, I’m going to do the same on this blog. Just write whatever and see what comes out of it. It’s my hope that something of value will result, either for you or me.&lt;/p&gt;
