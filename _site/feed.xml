I seek riches. They are memories, experiences, talents, knowledge, and wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve these things I need to learn, travel, and experience as much as I can in life. Thus, I grant myself to make mistakes and to celebrate my wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also know that my emotions are subjective, so enjoying every single moment is the key to a beautiful life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must do what I love and do them often. I must share with the world with what I have. And I must help others when I can. Because I want to leave a better world than the one I arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that Iâ€™m capable of much more than I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And do good. Always.&lt;/p&gt;
