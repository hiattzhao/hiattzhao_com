    <p>Two years ago, I tried to do a #30DaysOfCode to get better at web development. It’s a self imposed challenge where I would practice coding for 30 days straight. I didn’t complete that challenge and I think I only finished half way. Recently, I thought about what I did wrong and what I should change if I were to do something like that again.</p>

<p>First, I think 30 days is too long for me. To me a week is a good start so that I can gauge myself and see if I like the challenge to begin with. Seven days is not a huge time investment and I would only be a beginner at whatever I’ll be doing. And that’s fine with me.</p>

<p>Second, with the #30DaysOfCode challenge, it doesn’t specify how long I should code per day. Again, just to start, I think a 30 minute learning session is best for me since I do have a full-time job on the weekdays. If I choose to do more than 30 minutes then that’s great, but the minimum threshold is 30 minutes per day. I think that’s very doable for me.</p>

<p>Lastly, with #30DaysOfCode, it was with coding only and it was very popular on social media where people publicized their challenges. Though I did see others modifying the challenge to do 30 days of design, etc. I want to do a 30 minutes by 7 days challenge for anything that I might be interested in. This includes learning the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>React</li>
  <li>Angular</li>
  <li>Node</li>
  <li>Flutter</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Data science</li>
  <li>SQL server</li>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>Command line</li>
  <li>Machine learning</li>
  <li>Drawing</li>
  <li>Guitar</li>
</ul>

<p>If I learn each of these for 30 minutes a day for 7 days straight I’ll have a good introduction to each of these topics. If I want to continue learning the same topic then I’ll just do another 7 day challenge of the same subject matter. No pressure to complete a straight #30DaysOf challenge. I call my learning challenge the #30by7project. Foe example, if I start with learning React for 30 minutes a day for 7 days, it’ll be #30by7react challenge.</p>

<p>Starting tomorrow, I’ll start with my first challenge. Let’s see how it goes now that I’ve set the bar low.</p>
